<a name="originalrelease"></a><h2>Original Press Release</h2>

<p>
<b>11 August, 2007, Lausanne, Switzerland</b>: The Bacula Development Group today announces the release of version 2.2.0
of the Bacula Network Backup Solution.  This release adds features, maturity,
and performance requested by users, delivering quality and usability comparable
to enterprise backup solutions.  Version 2.2.0 is expected to drive even more
migrations toward Bacula.  The previous release was 2.0.3 on March 7, 2007.

<p>"This release introduces a new GUI interface, which reflects the increasing maturity of the product" said Bacula core 
team member and project co-founder Kern Sibbald.  "This is the best tested release ever made, and I would 
like to thank all the regression testers.  They have thoroughly tested it on 
FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OSX, and Solaris.  I have personally run the regression 
tests many times on CentOS 5 (RedHat derivative), OpenSUSE 10.2, and Mepis 
(Debian/Ubuntu derivative)".

<p>
<a name="additionalfeatures"></a>New features and tools to make network backups easier include:

<ul>
<li>Bat - new GUI now part of the project
<li>Optimized database performance to speed attribute insertion (approximately 10x 
    faster than previous versions)
<li>A new red/black algorithm used for building a restore tree in memory
    (approximately 500x faster)
<li>Added regex WHERE support to allow easier relocation of restored files
<li>posix_fadvise() use in the FD to improve performance reduces swapping due
    to opening/reading lots of files. Win32 equivalent implemented.
<li>Much improved Volume reservation code that should eliminate most
    conflicts experienced in multiple drive autochangers.
<li>Simpler locking in the SD in the reservation system.
<li>Detection of file size/date change during backup if enabled.
<li>Efficient implementation of very large include/exclude lists.
<li>Volumes are no longer pruned during 'status dir'
<li>Pruning is now more efficient, and if a Volume is purged,
    during pruning, it is immediately discovered.
<li>License is now GPL v2 without modifications
</ul>
