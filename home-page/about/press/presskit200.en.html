<a name="originalrelease"></a><h2>Original Press Release</h2>

<p>
<b>4 January 2007, Lausanne, Switzerland</b>: The Bacula Development Group today announces the release of version 2.0
of the Bacula Network Backup Solution.  This release adds features, maturity,
and performance requested by users, delivering quality and usability comparable
to enterprise backup solutions.  Version 2.0.0 is expected to drive even more
migrations toward Bacula.  The previous release was 1.38.11 on June 29, 2006.

<p>"Though I haven't done a detailed study, this release probably represents the 
largest addition of important features since Bacula's beginning," said Bacula core 
team member and project co-founder Kern Sibbald.  "This is in a 
large part due to the tremendous amount of community participation in the 
project -- thanks to everyone who made this possible".
