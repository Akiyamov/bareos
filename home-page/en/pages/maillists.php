<b>Bacula</b> has a number of email lists which are described below with
links to subscribe, unsubscribe, or modify your account.
For general information subscribing to or unsubscribing from these lists, please see
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=50727">Bacula Mailing Lists at SourceForge</a>.
<p>For email archives see the bottom of this page.</p>

Source Forge has rather strict email requirements in order to
try to minimize the large quantity of spam that the lists receive every day.
These are mesures that they have implemented, and over which we have no
control.
<p>
If you are having problems subscribing or sending email to a Bacula list,
please, read the following: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6695&group_id=1">
SourceForge.net: Email Problems: Spam, Bounces, Unreceived Messages</a>, then
if you are still having problems send a support request to Source Forge.
Source Forge requires the person affected submit his/her own support request;
the Bacula project is not permitted to do so on your behalf.  
<p>
One item they do not mention in the above referenced document is grey listing.
If you are using grey listing, you are likely to have problems with the Source
Forge email lists.  The solution is to whitelist their sending IPs.  You might
want to whitelist their whole zone (66.35.250.0/24) as I (Kern) have done, but
if you are more conservative, I found only two of their IPs were sending email
(66.35.250.225 and 66.35.250.206).  If you grey list individual Source Forge
IP addresses, please be sure to check your logs to verify the addresses they
use for you.
