   The Bacula project has assigned its copyright to the Free Software Foundation
   Europe e.V. in a fiduciary relationship that permits the FSFE to
   safeguard the Bacula software against abuse while allowing the project
   to continue without the administrative burden of maintaining the
   copyright paper work.
   <p>
   If you contribute more than a few lines of code or documentation to the
   Bacula project, we ask you to complete the copyright Fiduciary License
   Agreement (link provided below).  This is the same agreement that I (Kern)
   and the other developers have signed to transfer our copyrights to the
   FSFE.
   <p>
   Filling it out is really quite simple.  Please make two copies,
   then put your name and mailing address on the first page and
   date it.
   <p>
   On the third page after &quot;the author&quot; put your name and the
   other information requested. This is simply to uniquely identify
   you.  
   <p>
   If you are employed and you do Bacula work while at work
   or your employer has the rights to your work (often the case),
   please put your employer's information here.
   <p>
   On the fourth page, you can simply put &quot;All code and documentation
   contributed to the Bacula.org project&quot; or if you wish to be more
   specific please do so.
   <p>
   Finally, send the two filled out, signed copies to me at:<br><p>
   Kern Sibbald<br>
   Cotes-de-Montmoiret 9<br>
   1012 Lausanne<br>
   Switzerland<br>
   <p>
   and I will take note that you have filled it out, then I will send
   them on to the Free Software Foundation.
   <p>
   Thanks for taking the time to complete and send the FLA in.
