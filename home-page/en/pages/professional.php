    In October 2008, <a
    href="http://www.baculasystems.com">Bacula Systems SA</a>,
    the professional support organization specifically for Bacula
    was announced.  You can access the official press release 
    <a href="http://www.baculasystems.com/eng/About-us/Recent-news/Bacula-Systems-launches">
    here.</a><br><br>

    I (Kern) am the chairman and CTO of Bacula Systems, so I can personally
    vouch for the quality of support it provides. For those who are interested
    in why there is a need for Bacula Systems along side the Bacula Open Source
    community, please read my
    <a href="http://www.baculasystems.com/eng/About-us/Recent-news/Kern-Sibbald-s-letter-to-the-Community">
    Letter to the community</a>.<br><br>

    Bacula Systems offers subscriptions, training, consulting, and
    funded development services for all levels of Bacula users by working with
    and through qualified Bacula Systems Partners who are knowledgeable and
    close to the customer.  If you are interested in support, please see the
    Bacula Systems web site as follows:
