As you are probably aware, the community Windows File daemon binaries are no
longer produced by the Bacula project.  Consequently, as a service to the
community, Bacula Systems is offering its Windows Enterprise binaries at a
price that is designed to simply cover the costs to produce and distribute
those binaries.  These Enterprise Windows binaries are compatible with the
community Director and Storage daemon.  However, please note, that the Windows
Storage daemon and Director binaries are not provided.  Included in this
package is an installer for both 32 and 64 bit machines.  Support is not
offered by Bacula Systems, but is available through the Community Bugs
database.

In purchasing a license, by following the link below, you will
be able to download your Bacula Enterprise Windows binaries (32/64)
for a period of 3 months.  During this time, if there are additional
releases, you may also download them.  The license gives you the
right to use the downloaded Bacula Enterprise binaries with the
Bacula community version. This is a one time license fee that allows
you to continue using the downloaded binaries for as long as you respect
the terms of the license. After the 3 month download period, if you
want an updated Bacula Enterprise version, 
you will need to purchase a new license.
