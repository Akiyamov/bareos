   The Bacula developers have assigned their copyrights to 
   Kern Sibbald in a fiduciary relationship that permits Kern to
   safeguard the Bacula software against abuse.
   <p>
   If you contribute more than a few lines of code or documentation to the
   Bacula project, we ask you to complete the copyright Fiduciary License
   Agreement (link provided below).  This is the same agreement that all
   other developers have signed to transfer their copyrights to Kern.
   <p>
   Filling it out is really quite simple.  If you need a personal copy,
   please make two copies, otherwise one copy is sufficient,
   then put your name and mailing address on the page 2. 
   <p>
   If you are employed and you do Bacula work while at work
   or your employer has the rights to your work (often the case),
   please put your employer's information here.
   <p>
   On page 4, you can simply put &quot;All code and documentation
   contributed to the Bacula.org project&quot; or if you wish to be more
   specific please do so.
   <p>
   Finally, on page 5, put the city where you are, the date, and sign it,
   then send one or two copies to me. It is far better
   to send them by post, but if this is really not possible, please scan
   them and send them to me by email.<br><p>
