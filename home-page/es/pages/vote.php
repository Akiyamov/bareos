<h3>Voting Process</h3>
After every major release the Feature Requests that have been
submitted are collected together in the <b>projects</b> file, and
the list (for 2009 it was 40 items) of items is submitted to the
Bacula users for voting.

<p>The results of the voting then serve as a guide to developers for
what features are the most important (and the least) to implement.
The developers do not guarantee that any particular feature will be
implemented, but in general, the most important features as voted
by the users are given a lot of priority.

<p>To see the tabulated results of the 2009 vote, please follow the
