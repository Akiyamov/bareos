:index:`[TAG=Plugin] <single: Plugin>`

The functionality of Bareos can be extended by plugins. They do exists plugins for the different daemons (Director, Storage- and File-Daemon).

To use plugins, they must be enabled in the configuration (:strong:`Plugin Directory` and optionally :strong:`Plugin Names`).

If a :strong:`Plugin Directory` is specified :strong:`Plugin Names` defines, which plugins get loaded.

If :strong:`Plugin Names` is not defined, all plugins get loaded.
