Build instructions:                       

You must have at least the following packages loaded:
latex2html
te_latex
tetex

First, you must do:

  cd <docs>
  ./configure --with-bacula=<path-to-bacula-source>

  This will find the current Bacula version, and create
  all the Makefiles from Makefile.in  

  Do not edit the Makefiles or your changes will be lost. Always
  edit Makefile.in

Web site:  nothing to build, simply copy the files to the
           Web site, then load the documents in the appropriate
           places.


English manual:
   cd <docs>
   make

   The above builds all the Bacula English manuals.    
   At some point in the future, it will also build the
   other languages, when they are ready for distribution.

   Each subdirectory of manuals/en/xxx contains a subdirectory
   named xxx which contains the web version of that particular
   manual.  The pdf is in manuals/en/xxx/xxx.pdf

German manual:
   cd <docs>
   make german
   Same as above

French manual:
   cd <docs>
   make french
   Same as above:

A distribution is made by exporting the SVN then building everything
and finally tarring it up.
