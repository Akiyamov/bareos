I obtained the Windows screen shots by running the installer. When the
correct info is on screen, hit Alt-PrtScrn.  Then in PaintShop Pro,
paste the clipboard (ctl-v).  Then write it to my Unix bacula/docs/images
directory in .png format. Once on Unix, convert it to .eps with:

   make converteps

edit the Makefile to add new image names if necessary.

   make convertpdf
