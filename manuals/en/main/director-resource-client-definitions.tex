\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Address}{}{}{%
Where the address is a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or a
network address in dotted quad notation for a Bareos File server daemon.
This directive is required.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Auth Type}{}{}{%
Specifies the authentication type that must be supplied when connecting to
a backup protocol that uses a specific authentication type.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Auto Prune}{}{}{%
If AutoPrune is set to  {\bf yes}, Bareos
will  automatically apply the File retention period and the Job  retention
period for the Client at the end of the Job.  If you leave the default {\bf AutoPrune = no},
pruning will not be done, and your Catalog will grow in size each time you
run a Job.  Pruning affects only information in the catalog and not data
stored in the backup archives (on Volumes), but if pruning deletes all data
referring to a certain volume, the volume is regarded as empty and will possibly
be overwritten before the volume retention has expired.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Catalog}{}{}{%
This specifies the  name of the catalog resource to be used for this Client.
If none is specified the first defined catalog is used.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Description}{}{}{%
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Enabled}{}{}{%
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{FD Address}{}{}{%
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{FD Password}{}{}{%
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{FD Port}{}{}{%
Where the port is a port  number at which the Bareos File server daemon can
be contacted.  The default is 9102. For NDMP backups set this to 10000.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{File Retention}{}{}{%
The File Retention directive defines the length of time that  Bareos will
keep File records in the Catalog database after the End time of the
Job corresponding to the File records.
When this time period expires, and if
{\bf AutoPrune} is set to  {\bf yes} Bareos will prune (remove) File records
that  are older than the specified File Retention period. Note, this  affects
only records in the catalog database. It does not  affect your archive
backups.

File records  may actually be retained for a shorter period than you specify
on  this directive if you specify either a shorter \linkResourceDirective{Dir}{Client}{Job Retention}  or a
shorter \linkResourceDirective{Dir}{Pool}{Volume Retention} period. The shortest  retention period of the
three takes precedence.  The time may be expressed in seconds, minutes,
hours, days, weeks, months, quarters, or years. See the
\ilink{ Configuration chapter}{Time} of this  manual for
additional details of time specification.

The  default is 60 days.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Hard Quota}{}{}{%
This is the maximal amount this client can backup before any backup Job
will be aborted.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Heartbeat Interval}{}{}{%
This directive is optional and if specified will cause the Director to
set a keepalive interval (heartbeat) in seconds on each of the sockets
it opens for the Storage resource.  This value will override any
specified at the Director level.  It is implemented only on systems
(Linux, ...) that provide the {\bf setsockopt} TCP\_KEEPIDLE function.
The default value is zero, which means no change is made to the socket.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Job Retention}{}{}{%
The Job Retention directive defines the length of time that  Bareos will keep
Job records in the Catalog database after the Job End time.  When
this time period expires, and if {\bf AutoPrune} is set to {\bf yes}
Bareos will prune (remove) Job records that are older than the specified
File Retention period.  As with the other retention periods, this
affects only records in the catalog and not data in your archive backup.

If a Job record is selected for pruning, all associated File and JobMedia
records will also be pruned regardless of the File Retention period set.
As a consequence, you normally will set the File retention period to be
less than the Job retention period.  The Job retention period can actually
be less than the value you specify here if you set the {\bf Volume
Retention} directive in the Pool resource to a smaller duration.  This is
because the Job retention period and the Volume retention period are
independently applied, so the smaller of the two takes precedence.

The Job retention period is specified as seconds,  minutes, hours, days,
weeks, months,  quarters, or years.  See the
\ilink{ Configuration chapter}{Time} of this manual for
additional details of  time specification.

The default is 180 days.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Maximum Bandwidth Per Job}{}{}{%
The speed parameter specifies the maximum allowed bandwidth that a job may use
when started for this Client. The speed parameter should be specified in
k/s, Kb/s, m/s or Mb/s.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Maximum Concurrent Jobs}{}{}{%
where {\textless}number{\textgreater}  is the maximum number of Jobs with the current Client
that  can run concurrently. Note, this directive limits only Jobs  for Clients
with the same name as the resource in which it appears. Any  other
restrictions on the maximum concurrent jobs such as in  the Director, Job, or
Storage resources will also apply in addition to  any limit specified here.
The  default is set to 1, but you may set it to a larger number.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Name}{}{}{%
The client name which will be used in the  Job resource directive or in the
console run command.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{NDMP Block Size}{}{}{%
This directive sets the default NDMP blocksize for this client.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{NDMP Log Level}{}{}{%
This directive sets the loglevel for the NDMP protocol library.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Passive}{}{13.2}{%
The normal way of initializing the data channel (the channel where the backup data itself is transported)
is done by the file daemon (client) that connects to the storage daemon.

By using the client passive mode, the initialization of the datachannel is reversed, so that the storage daemon connects to the filedaemon.

See chapter \ilink{Passive Client}{PassiveClient}.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Password}{}{}{%
This is the password to be  used when establishing a connection with the File
services, so  the Client configuration file on the machine to be backed up
must  have the same password defined for this Director.
If you have either \file{/dev/random} or {\bf bc} on your machine,
Bareos will generate a random  password during the configuration process,
otherwise it will  be left blank.

The password is plain text.  It is not generated through any special
process, but it is preferable for security reasons to make the text
random.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Port}{}{}{%
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Protocol}{Native{\textbar}NDMP}{13.2.0}{%
The backup protocol to use to run the Job.

Currently the director understand the following protocols:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Native - The native Bareos protocol
\item NDMP - The NDMP protocol
\end{enumerate}
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Quota Include Failed Jobs}{}{}{%
When calculating the amount a client used take into consideration any failed Jobs.
Default {\bf Yes}.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Soft Quota}{}{}{%
This is the amount after which there will be a warning issued that a client
is over his softquota. A client can keep doing backups until it hits the
hardquota or when the Soft Quota Graceperiod is expired.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Soft Quota Grace Period}{}{}{%
Time allowed for a client to be over its softquota before it will be enforced.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Client}{Strict Quotas}{}{}{%
The directive Strict Quotas determines, if after the Grace Time Period is over,
the Burst Limit is enforced (Strict Quotas = {\bf No}) or
the Soft Limit is enforced (Strict Quotas = {\bf Yes}).

how the Bareos Director (and the other components) must be configured to use TLS.
