\begin{itemize}
\item The minimum versions for each of the databases supported by Bareos
   are:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item MySQL 4.1
   \item PostgreSQL 7.4
   \item SQLite 3
   \end{itemize}
\item Windows release is cross-compiled on Linux
\item Bareos requires a good implementation of pthreads to work.  This
   is not the case on some of the BSD systems.
\item The source code has been written with portability in mind and is  mostly
   POSIX compatible. Thus porting to any POSIX compatible  operating system
   should be relatively easy.
\end{itemize}
