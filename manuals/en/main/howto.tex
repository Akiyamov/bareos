If you are running a database in production mode on your machine, Bareos will
happily backup the files, but if the database is in use while Bareos is
reading it, you may back it up in an unstable state.

The best solution is to shutdown your database before backing it up, or use
some tool specific to your database to make a valid live copy perhaps by
dumping the database in ASCII format.
