The Autochanger resource supports single or multiple drive
autochangers by grouping one or more Device resources
into one unit called an autochanger in Bareos (often referred to
as a "tape library" by autochanger manufacturers).

If you have an Autochanger, and you want it to function correctly,
you {\bf must} have an Autochanger resource in your Storage
conf file, and your Director's Storage directives that want to
use an Autochanger must refer to the Autochanger resource name.

\input{autogenerated/bareos-sd-resource-autochanger-table.tex}
\input{bareos-sd-resource-autochanger-definitions.tex}
\input{autogenerated/bareos-sd-resource-autochanger-description.tex}

The following is an example of a valid Autochanger resource definition:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
Autochanger {
  Name = "DDS-4-changer"
  Device = DDS-4-1, DDS-4-2, DDS-4-3
  Changer Device = /dev/sg0
  Changer Command = "/usr/lib/bareos/scripts/mtx-changer %c %o %S %a %d"
}
Device {
  Name = "DDS-4-1"
  Drive Index = 0
  Autochanger = yes
  ...
}
Device {
  Name = "DDS-4-2"
  Drive Index = 1
  Autochanger = yes
  ...
Device {
  Name = "DDS-4-3"
  Drive Index = 2
  Autochanger = yes
  Autoselect = no
  ...
}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

Please note that it is important to include the {\bf Autochanger = yes} directive
in each Device definition that belongs to an Autochanger.  A device definition
should not belong to more than one Autochanger resource.  Also, your Device
directive in the Storage resource of the Director's conf file should have
the Autochanger's resource name rather than a name of one of the Devices.

If you have a drive that physically belongs to an Autochanger but you don't want
to have it automatically used when Bareos references the Autochanger for backups,
for example, you want to reserve it for restores, you can add the directive:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
Autoselect = no
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

to the Device resource for that drive. In that case, Bareos will not automatically
select that drive when accessing the Autochanger. You can still use the drive
by referencing it by the Device name directly rather than the Autochanger name. An example
of such a definition is shown above for the Device DDS-4-3, which will not be
selected when the name DDS-4-changer is used in a Storage definition, but will
be used if DDS-4-3 is used.
