## How to contribute to Barbossa

As a free software project, Barbossa is very open to your contributions. You don't need developer 
skills to help, there are several non-coding ways to get involved in a project (code is welcome 
too, of course!).

### Mailing lists

### Localization

### Testing and quality accurance

One important thing for us is avoid problems in the user interface. Your can really help us out here
providing feedback on releases and especially by testing the pre-releases (alpha/beta/rc) we provide
for testing. Just download them and report any issues you face with them.

### Documentation

Do you feel our documentation misses some points? We welcome additions; just let us know how you think 
the documentation can be improved. The best way is to submit a pull request against our GitHub
repository.

### Developing

Coding contribution are very welcome, the easiest way is to fork our code on github and submit a
pull request. We really welcome bug fixes or new features.
