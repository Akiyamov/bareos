## How to contribute to Barbossa

As a free software project, Barbossa is very open to your contributions. You don't need developer 
skills to help, there are several non-coding ways to get involved in a project (code is welcome 
too, of course!).

### Mailing lists

### Localization

For localization, the Bareos Web-Frontend uses Gettext; you can find po files for each translation 
in the language directory https://github.com/fbergkemper/barbossa/tree/master/module/Application/language.
You can translate them using the usual tools for handling Gettext translations, e.g. Poedit.

### Testing and quality assurance

One important thing for us is to avoid problems in the user interface. You can really help us out here
providing feedback on releases and especially by testing the pre-releases (alpha/beta/rc) we provide
for testing. Just download them and report any issues you face with them.

### Documentation

Do you feel our documentation misses some points? We welcome additions; just let us know how you think 
the documentation can be improved. The best way is to submit a pull request against our GitHub
repository.

### Developing

Coding contributions are very welcome, the easiest way is to fork our code on github and submit a
pull request. We really welcome bug fixes or new features.
